Project Title: Building Model to predict Falcon9's Landing Outcome and Visualizing Launch Sites and their launching success rate 

For Capstone Project

This Project is about predicting the Landing Outcome (will the rocket land successfully or not) by using published Falcon9 data from SpaceX and creating Maps and Dashboards to visualize the Launch Sites and their launching success rate.

The tasks of this project are as follows:

Task-1: Data Collecting by using API and Web Scraping.
Task-2: Data Wrangling.
Task-3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL and Visualization. 
Task-4: Creating interactive Maps and Dashboard.
Task-5: Building a Predictive Model and Evaluating the models to choose the best one. 

Methodology: In model selection for predicting landing outcomes, the dataset is tested with four different models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree Classifier, and KNN) and evaluated their performance with confusion matrics and accuracy scores. The best model for this project is the Decision Tree Classifier with 94% accuracy in the test dataset. For visualizing the Launch Sites and their success rate, Folium and Plotly Dash are used to create interactive maps and dashboards, respectively. 

Results: By using the Decision Tree Classifier, we can predict will the rocket land successfully or not. The interactive map and dashboard give the geographical observations of the Launch Sites and their success rate.
